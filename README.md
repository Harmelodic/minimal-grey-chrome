# chrome-theme-minimal-grey

A new minimalist, grey Chrome theme.

## Why?

Because:

- [My old Chrome theme](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/harmelodic-custom/nlgaidjddhmbibdbialabgoligelmknb) doesn't look as good as it could be on the new Chrome update (v69).
- I've never properly developed a Chrome extension before; even my old Chrome theme was developed using a little tool.
